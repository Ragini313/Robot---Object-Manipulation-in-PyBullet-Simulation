# üß† Intelligent Robotic Manipulation

## üöÄ Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop an intelligent robotic system capable of **grasping a YCB object** and **placing it in a designated goal basket**, all while **avoiding dynamic and static obstacles**. The challenge integrates elements from perception, control, motion planning, and manipulation in a simulated environment.

> üîí Note: Solutions must not use any privileged information from the simulation environment.

## üß© Task Breakdown (Guidance Only)

The following are the implemented subtasks;:

1. **Perception**  
   Detect and identify graspable YCB objects in the scene.

2. **Controller**  
   Move the robot arm in response to planned trajectories and control commands.

3. **Grasp Execution**  
   Sample grasp poses and execute reliable grasps on the identified object.

4. **Obstacle Localization & Tracking**  
   Detect, localize, and track obstacles in the environment to ensure safe planning.

5. **Trajectory Planning**  
   Plan and execute a collision-free trajectory to transport the object to the goal basket.
